<h1 align="center" >How to Play</h1>
The game board is a 3x3 grid.
Each player takes turns to place their symbol ('X' or 'O') on the board.
The first player to get three symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
If all spaces on the board are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a tie.
