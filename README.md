- The game board is a 3x3 grid.<br>

- Each player takes turns to place their symbol ('X' or 'O') on the board.<br>

- The first player to get three symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.<br>

- If all spaces on the board are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a tie.<br><hr>
